This section combines concepts from all previous sections at an Olympiad level. Show detailed reasoning and work for full credit.

Prove that the expression $5 + 3 \times 2 - 4$ can be re–grouped (using mental parentheses) to yield the same final value as $(5 + 3) \times 2 - 4$.

Write both your grouping and the computed result.
